# Diabetic-Prediction-Classifier
This project has been carried out in collaboration with Supriya Patil and Umesh Salunke , where we are predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not.

The datasets consist of 8 medical predictor (independent) variables

Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant

Glucose concentration - Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

Blood Pressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

Body mass index - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

Diabetes Pedigree Function - Diabetes pedigree function

Age - Age (years)

We as a team did data analysis , data cleaning, feature engineering , created visulizations and created ML models like - Logistic Regression, SVM with liner kernel, SVM with RBF kernel, SVM with Poly kernel, SVM with Hyper Paramter learning, Naive based classifer,KNN Classifier model to find the model with the highest accuracy and measured the accuracy through classification report an confusion matrix.

The data set for the same is uploaded as DIABETIC.csv

The Notebook for code is .ipnb file
